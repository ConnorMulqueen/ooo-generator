          Whether you're going on a tropical trip or signing off for a
          staycation, you have to write an out of office message. So, why not
          write a good one? Saying you have "limited access to Wifi" isn't
          fooling anyone. It's 2018, after all.

          Share quick details about your time away and the generator will give
          you an 'OOO' email that's as fun as your vacation. (Well, almost.)
