Ho-Ho-Ho!

Or perhaps I should say OOO...

I'm currently hanging with Mr. Claus in [Destination] where we'll be [Activity] together from [Leave Date] to [Return Date].

There wasn't enough room for everyone on this sleigh, so we left [ER Contact Name] at the office to help you out with problems in my absence. You can reach them at [ER Contact Email].

Cheers!
